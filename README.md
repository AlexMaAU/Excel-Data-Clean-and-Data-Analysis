Dataset: bike_buyers from Kaggle

- The original dataset was duplicated onto a working sheet to prevent contamination of the raw data.
- Data cleansing was performed on the working sheet, removing duplicate entries and standardizing the format of columns such as Marriage, Gender, and Home Owner for better data comprehension.
- A Pivot Table was created based on the working sheet to facilitate the creation of basic chart components.
- A Dynamic Dashboard was developed based on the Pivot Table, providing a visual foundation for comprehensive data analysis.

Key Findings:

- Within the married population with a high school education, a majority fall within the age range of 0-30, indicating lower interest in bike purchases.
- Married individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher education exhibit a noticeable increase in bike purchase rates, possibly due to heightened environmental awareness or a desire for healthier commuting options.
- Married individuals with more children show a higher inclination towards bike purchases, potentially driven by the need to acquire bikes for their children, particularly in families with three or more children.
- Single individuals with a high school education and lower average income display a higher desire for bike purchases, likely due to financial constraints preventing them from affording cars, thus opting for more economical commuting options.
- Single individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher education, typically with higher average income, also show a strong desire for bike purchases, particularly in households with three or more children, likely for similar reasons of purchasing for their children.
- Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that the ideal target demographic for bike marketing comprises individuals with lower incomes and those with children, as they are more willing to purchase bikes for themselves or their children to meet commuting needs.
